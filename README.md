- Hello, I'm NastyDogBreath.  My name comes from a dog I had, Rex when I graduated from college.  I wanted to find some unique name, and that one fit.  I also dated someone really ugly, who had a dog face.
- I have around 25 years of experience, mostly in Microsoft Technologies.  I've started to shift my focus towards a more JS centric frontend, which makes a better user experience
